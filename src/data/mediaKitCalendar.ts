It's missing documentation.

→ No photo of the install
→ No record of the settings used
→ No proof the checklist was followed

When the customer calls back, your tech is guessing. The manufacturer says "prove it." And you eat the cost.

The fix? Make documentation as easy as a tap.

That's exactly what we built at FieldTek.

Here's what the best plumbing companies do differently:

1. Rotating on-call schedules (not the same guy every weekend)
2. Premium pay that actually compensates for disrupted sleep
3. Next-day follow-up so one tech doesn't carry the whole load
4. Documentation systems that capture everything at 3 AM

Your team isn't just fixing pipes. They're sacrificing sleep for your customers.

Make it worth it.
